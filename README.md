## Compression of 3D coordinates of macromolecular structures
This repository contains the compression methods described in the paper "Towards an efficient compression of 3D coordinates of macromolecular structures". These methods provide the foundation for a novel standard to represent macromolecular coordinates in a **M**acro**M**olecular **T**ransmission **F**ormat for 3D structures (http://mmtf.rcsb.org). This format allows a compact representation and interactive visualization of the largest macromolecular complexes that are currently in the Protein Data Bank.
